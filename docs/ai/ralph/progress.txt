## Codebase Patterns
- Use `as unknown as vscode.ExtensionContext` for test mocks instead of `any` type
- Prefix unused parameters with `_` to satisfy ESLint `no-unused-vars` rule
- VS Code settings use `unknown` type since they can be any value
- ESLint is configured with `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/recommended`
- For preset-based configs, DON'T use `default` in package.json - use `config.get(key, fallback)` so presets work correctly
