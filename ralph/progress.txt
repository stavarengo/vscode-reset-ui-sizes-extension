# Ralph Progress Log - Codebase Fixes

Branch: ralph/codebase-fixes
Started: 2026-01-17

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `as unknown as vscode.ExtensionContext` for test mocks instead of `any` type
- Prefix unused parameters with `_` to satisfy ESLint `no-unused-vars` rule
- VS Code settings use `unknown` type since they can be any value
- ESLint is configured with `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/recommended`

---

## 2026-01-17 - US-001
- **What was implemented**: Added ESLint configuration with TypeScript support
- **Files changed**:
  - Created `.eslintrc.json` with parser, plugins, and rules
  - Fixed `src/test/suite/resetAllSizes.test.ts` - replaced `any` types with proper type casting
  - Fixed `src/utils/index.ts` - changed `any` to `unknown`, added underscore prefix for unused param
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ESLint dependencies were already installed in package.json, just needed the config file
  - Mock contexts in tests should use `as unknown as vscode.ExtensionContext` pattern
  - The `_workspaceFolder` parameter in `updateSetting()` is intentionally unused pending US-004 fix

Commit: b94d8e0
- **What was implemented**: Replaced dangerous `workbench.action.reloadWindow` command in test with safe `workbench.action.showCommands`
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/test/suite/utils.test.ts` - replaced reload command with showCommands, updated assertion to expect `true`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `workbench.action.showCommands` is a safe VS Code command for testing executeVSCodeCommand()
  - The VS Code test framework may have issues in headless/CI environments (bad option errors for --no-sandbox etc.) - this is an infrastructure issue, not code issue
